## Descriptions

In this repository, the file "function_main.Rmd" is the main Rmarkdown file that details a complete solution to the exercises laid out in the assignment worksheet. Its companion file "function_main.md" is the knitted version of the aforementioned Rmd file, produced in a format suitable for the github audience.

## Instructions

To run the code within the Rmd file, one should first take care to install the "testthat", "dplyr" and "palmerpenguins" packages. As a result of later chunks requiring variables defined in earlier chunks, it is crucial that one run the code chucks in sequence from top to bottom.
